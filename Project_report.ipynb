Individuals infected with this disease could experience symptoms such as shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, fever, fatigue, and much more. This disease can impact certain individuals more than others depending on preexisting health conditions.  \n",

We will be using certain predictors such as age, sex, obesity, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes to predict the probability of individuals being infected with coronavirus. These predictors will be further explained in the methods section. \n"
